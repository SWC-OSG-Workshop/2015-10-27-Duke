title: Distributed Computing on Open Science Grid
---

High throughput computing is an excellent fit for:

*    Your computation can be split into many independent jobs
*    Your workflow involves individual jobs be run on a single processor
*    Your applications can be interrupted and restarted at a later time 

Come to this session to learn all about DHTC and the basics of grid computing.
