>  become more productive by teaching them basic lab skills for computing
>  like program design, version control, data management, and task automation.

Come to this session to learn all about DHTC and the basics of grid computing. For example, 

*    what is distributed high throughput computing 
*    what are the best practices of DHTC
*    How to split your computation into many independent jobs
*    How to manage a scientific workflow
