title: Distributed Computing on Open Science Grid
---


High throughput computing is an excellent fit for you if:

*    Your science workflow involves computations that can be split into many independent jobs
*    Your workflow involves individual jobs be run on a single processor (as opposed to a single large-scale MPI job simultaneously utilizing many processors).
*    Your applications can be interrupted and restarted at a later time or on another processor or computing site?
Not sure what this means? Come to this session to learn all about DHTC and the basics of grid computing.
